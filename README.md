# day-6--fgc-website-clone-
federal governmant college warri (FGCW) school portal clone.

As part of my learning i decided to rebuild my secondary school portal website.
this is a simple site made with html and css, I will do a react version of this soon.

# What I learnt while working on this project.
- I got used to some of the basic syntaxes while using them repeatedly.
- I understood the basic arrangement of a webpage and how to build one also.
- It taught me that anything can be done with the right mindset and right resources.

I have a lot to learn and keep learning.
